研究活动轨迹数据库上高效的同步搜索问题。
给定查询位置序列，每个查询位置与一组期望活动相关联，查询返回覆盖查询活动并产生最短最小匹配距离的k个轨迹。
提出了顺序敏感活动轨迹相似性查询以考虑查询位置的顺序。为了有效地处理查询，我们首先开发一个新的混合网格索引，以分层组织轨迹段和活动，通过位置接近和活动抑制修剪搜索空间。
提出了计算最小匹配距离和最小顺序敏感匹配距离的算法。

> Identifying the similar activity trajectories to a given query is very useful for place recommendation and trip planning. Consider the example in Figure 1 where a tourist plans to visit three places q1 , q2 , q3 in a city and conduct activities {a, b}, {c, d}, {e}, respectively. Because he is not familiar with this city, he would like to look at the travelling histories of other people nearby his intended locations for reference. If only the geometric property of the trajectories is to be considered, we can apply the best match distance measure proposed by Chen et al [20], which aims at searching for similar trajectories with respect to multiple query locations. By doing so, Tr1 will be taken as the most promising result since its points p1,1, p1,3, p1,5 are closer to the query points than Tr2. But obviously the tourist will not be satisfied by this result since p1,1,p1,3 do not cover his intended activities. On the other hand, T r2 can be a better reference for the tourist as it has the points around each query location while matching the activities (p2,1,p2,2 for q1, p2,3 for q2, p2,5 for q3), though it is a bit further than Tr1 from pure geographical aspect.

说的是考虑需求和距离，有的时候就算是距离远也是一个更好的方案，因为它的路程才是包含了用户真正的需求的一条路径，也是作为一种方案的修正。

### 结论
>This paper studies the problem of efficient similarity search on the trajectories associated with activity information, given multiple query locations with activity requirement. Two types of queries, ATSQ and OATSQ, are proposed depending on whether the order of query points is considered. To support efficient query processing, we develop a novel hybrid grid index called GAT, and propose efficient algorithms to compute the minimum match distance and minimum order-sensitive match distance between a query and a trajectory. Extensive experimental results based on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several baseline algorithms significantly and achieves good scalability.

> In this paper, we propose a citywide and real-time model for estimating the travel time of any path (represented as a sequence of connected road segments) in real time in a city, based on the GPS trajectories of vehicles received in current time slots and over a period of history as well as map data sources. Though this is a strategically important task in many traffic monitoring and routing systems, the problem has not been well solved yet given the following three challenges. The first is the data sparsity problem, i.e., many road segments may not be traveled by any GPS-equipped vehicles in present time slot. In most cases, we cannot find a trajectory exactly traversing a query path either. Second, for the fragment of a path with trajectories, they are multiple ways of using (or combining) the trajectories to estimate the corresponding travel time. Finding an optimal combination is a challenging problem, subject to a tradeoff between the length of a path and the number of trajectories traversing the path (i.e., support). Third, we need to instantly answer users’ queries which may occur in any part of a given city. This calls for an efficient, scalable and effective solution that can enable a citywide and real-time travel time estimation. To address these challenges, we model different drivers’ travel times on different road segments in different time slots with a three dimension tensor. Combined with geospatial, temporal and historical contexts learned from trajectories and map data, we fill in the tensor’s missing values through a context- aware tensor decomposition approach. We then devise and prove an object function to model the aforementioned tradeoff, with which we find the most optimal concatenation of trajectories for an estimate through a dynamic programming solution. In addition, we propose using frequent trajectory patterns (mined from historical trajectories) to scale down the candidates of concatenation and a suffix-tree-based index to manage the trajectories received in the present time slot. We evaluate our method based on extensive experiments, using GPS trajectories generated by more than 32,000 taxis over a period of two months. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our method beyond baseline approaches.

基于当前时隙中接收的车辆的GPS轨迹，估计城市中实时的任何路径的行进时间。
该问题还没有很好地解决。
-  第一个是数据稀疏问题，即，在当前时隙中，许多路段可能不被任何配备GPS的车辆行驶。
-  第二，对于具有轨迹的路径的片段，它们是使用轨迹以估计对应的行进时间的多种方式。找到最佳组合是一个具有挑战性的问题，取决于路径的长度和穿过路径的轨迹的数量之间的权衡.
-  第三，我们需要立即回答可能发生在给定城市的任何部分的用户的查询。
结合从轨迹和地图数据学习的地理空间，时间和历史上下文，我们通过情境感知张量分解方法填充张量的缺失值通过动态规划找到最佳的估计轨迹。使用频繁的轨迹模式缩小连接的候选。

模型架构

> To model the traffic conditions of the current time slot, we construct a tensor             , with the three dimensions standing for road segments, drivers and time slots, respectively, based on the GPS trajectories received in the most recent   time slots and the road network data. As shown in Figure 3, an entry      ,  ,        denotes the  th road segment is traveled by the  th driver with a time cost   in time slot   (e.g., 2-2:30pm).

>Once a trajectory is selected as a ground truth, we remove them from the training data. In total, we generate 12,384 queries, whose length ranges from 2KM to 16KM following the distribution as shown in Figure 11 B) and time span follows the distribution depicted in Figure 11 C).

根据路径长度的分布和根据时间路径时间的分布


文章的数据集已下，实验没有细看，待细看实践重现的时候再深入。

> In this paper, we propose a real-time and citywide model, called PTTE, to estimate the travel time of a path in current time slot in a city’s road network, using the GPS trajectories from a sample of vehicles (e.g. taxicabs). Though this is a very important foundation for many traffic monitoring and routing systems, the problem has not been well solved given three challenges: 1) data sparsity, 2) finding an optimal combination of trajectories (i.e., the tradeoff between the length of a sub-path and the number of trajectories passing the sub-path), and 3) the tradeoff between scalability, effectiveness and efficiency. PTTE is comprised of two major components, CATD and OC. The former infers the travel time of a road segment without being traversed by trajectories in the current time slot through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach. The latter searches for the most optimal concatenation of trajectories for a query path using a dynamic programing solution. We evaluate PTTE with extensive experiments based on GPS trajectories generated by over 32,000 taxicabs over a period of two months in Beijing. We test the effectiveness and efficiency of CATD and OC, respectively. First, the results demonstrate the advantages of CATD in accurately filling in the missing values beyond baseline methods, such as using speed constraints, or using a historical average travel time, or using a matrix factorization- based approach. The driver dimension in tensor   helps us calculate the variance of different drivers’ travel times on a road segment. The variance indicates the complexity of a road’s traffic condition, helping us find the most optimal concatenation for a path. In addition, the geospatial/temporal contexts and historical traffic patterns increase the accuracy of estimating the missing values. Regarding the most optimal concatenation, we devise an objective function which has been proved to be able to model the tradeoff between a sub-path’s length and the number of trajectories passing it. Tested by 12,384 query paths, PTTE achieves a mean absolute error of 0.4min per km, which is about 19% of the truth travel time. The results of the in-the-field study have an even smaller estimation error (11.6%). Using the suffix-tree-based indexing structure to manage the trajectories received currently and the trajectory patterns (mined in advance) to scale down the concatenation candidates, on average, we are able to infer the travel time of a path in 2.3ms. The codes and a sample of the data used here have been released at [25]. In the future, we plan to infer the travel time of a path for a particular driver. In addition, we would like to study the impact of other factors, such as weather conditions and air quality, on the travel time estimation of a path.

在虽然这对于许多业务监视和路由系统是非常重要的基础，但是给定三个挑战还没有很好地解决该问题：1）数据稀疏，2）找到轨道的最佳组合，以及3）可伸缩性，有效性和效率之间的折衷。 PTTE由两个主要成分，CATD和OC组成。前者通过情境感知张量分解方法推断道路段的行进时间，而不被当前时隙中的轨迹穿过。后者使用动态编程解决方案搜索查询路径的最佳轨迹的连接。CATD在准确填充超过基线方法的缺失值（例如使用速度约束或使用历史平均行进时间）或使用基于矩阵分解的方法的优点。张量的驾驶员维度帮助我们计算不同驾驶员在路段上的行驶时间的方差。方差表示道路的交通状况的复杂性，帮助我们找到路径的最佳连接。此外，地理空间/时间上下文和历史流量模式提高了估计缺失值的准确性。关于最优的级联，我们设计了一个目标函数，已经证明能够对子路径的长度和通过它的轨迹数之间的权衡建模。能够在2.3ms中推断路径的行进时间在未来，我们计划推断一个特定司机的路径的行程时间。此外，我们想研究其他因素，如天气条件和空气质量对路径的行程时间估计的影响。

> In this paper, we focus on data generated by Instagram to discover the JG Trajectory Patterns (i.e., JG T-Patterns) from travel trajectories. Previous researches on T-Patterns mining concentrate on GPS-based data, which is different from Instagram data, a kind of UGC- based (User Generated Content based) data. GPS-based data is dense because it is often generated automatically by moving devices in a certain pace, while UGC-based data is sparse because data is generated randomly by the uploading of users. Aiming at this, a novel JG T-Patterns mining strategy from UGC-based data is also proposed. Finally, a demo for discovering hot travel routes based on JG T-Patterns from Instagram trajectories, named PopTour, is implemented and experimental results show that PopTour is an effective system

于Instagram生成的数据，从旅行轨迹中发现JG轨迹模式。之前关于T-Pattern挖掘的研究集中于基于GPS的数据，这与Instagram数据不同，后者是一种基于用户生成的内容数据。基于GPS的数据是密集的，因为它通常通过以一定速度移动设备来自动生成，而基于UGC的数据是稀疏的，因为数据是通过用户的上传随机生成的。 提出了一种基于UGC数据的新型JG T-Pattern挖掘策略。 

> Architecture of PopTour is shown in Figure 1. The Data Extractor is responsible for collecting raw data such as userID, title, image URL, geo-location, timestamp, and comments from Instagram application. The geo-tagged data must be preprocessed by Data Cleaner to generate trajectory data and stored into MongoDB database. On the JG T- Patterns Miner running, it manipulates runtime data structure preparation according to trajectories stored in MongoDB. Grid-based index is used to partition geo-space. JG T- Patterns Miner consists of two components to discover JG T-Patterns. Cluster Detector is used to carry on density- based clustering method, and the function of JG T-Patterns Validator is to identify clusters to see if they are JG T- Patterns. Finally, the discovered JG T-Patterns are visualized by Results Visualizer on Google Map to recommend hot travel routes for users.

>This paper has presented a novel application of time-series forecasting techniques to improve taxi-driver mobility in- telligence. Thjs was done by transforming both the GPS and event signals emitted by 441 taxis from a company operating in Porto, Portugal (where the passenger demand is lower than the number of vacant taxis), into a time series of interest to use first as a learning base for our model and second as a streaming test framework. As a result, the model that is presented has been able to predict the taxi–passenger demand at each one of the 63 taxi stands for 30-min period intervals.This model will be used as a feature for a recommenda- tion system (to be developed), which will produce smart live recommendations to the taxi drivers about which taxi stand they should head to after a drop-off. This decision support framework will also address other features such as distance or live traffic conditions. We believe that the deployment of such a system in a taxi fleet will contribute to increasing its competitiveness facing other taxi fleets in a Scenario-1 network (e.g., such as the network that was studied, where the average waiting time to pick up a passenger at a taxi stand is three times higher than the average service duration) by improving the distribution of the vacant vehicles throughout the stands.

本文提出了时间序列预测技术的新颖应用，以提高出租车司机的移动智能。通过将来自在葡萄牙波尔图（其中乘客需求低于空置的出租车的数量）的公司的441个出租车发出的GPS和事件信号转换为感兴趣的时间序列，首先用作学习基础为我们的模型，第二个作为流测试框架。因此，所提出的模型已经能够预测在63个出租车站每个30分钟时间间隔的出租车乘客需求。

这个模型将被用作推荐系统（待开发）的一个功能，它将为出租车司机提供智能直播建议，在出租车司机后，他们应该在出租车出租车站后到达。此决策支持框架还将解决其他功能，如距离或实时交通条件。我们认为，在出租车车队中部署这样的系统将有助于提高其在场景1网络中其他出租车车队的竞争力（例如，研究的网络，其中平均等候乘客的时间在的士站是比平均服务时间高三倍），通过改善空车在整个展台的分布。
