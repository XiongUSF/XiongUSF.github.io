## Background

**The air traffic flow management problem with enroute capacities**

+ bertsimas
+ 1998 
+ *Operations research* (运筹学)
+ cited by 561

**Cplex is used to solve four basic problems such as ：**

+ linear programming (LP), 
+ quadratic programming (QP), 
+ quadratic programming with constraints (QCQP), 
+ second-order cone programming (SOCP). 

**Cplex 3 advantages:**

+ The solution speed is very **fast**; 
+ sometimes it also provides **superlinear** **acceleration**.
+ **Functional** **advantages**.

As you know, I've worked for 4 years, however, I am not familiar with Cplex and its c plus plus Reference Manual. So I took several days to understood it approximately.

## paper review

Definitely speaking, this paper including 6 parts.

+ TFMP formulation
+ comlexity of TFMP
+ model variations
+ insights from stucture
+ Insights from computations
+ conclusion

As the requirements asked. I will discuss the issues as below:

Firstly,



#### Motivation

In my opinion, when we do research or reading a paper. we should know:

What's the problem? Why you do it? what about the others have done? Then how you do it? How could you evaluate it?(such as make a comparation with others or yourself experiments.)

##### **Problem in this paper.**

Due to the demand for airport use has been increasing rapidly, however, airport capacity has been stagnating. Congestion on the air traffic system.



#### Contributions:

- 1、model that taking into account the (compara to others. or what about the others have done? )

  - capacities of NAS
  - capacities of airports

- 2、complexity of the problem is <u>**NP-Hard**</u> (point out its hard)

- 3、account for several variations of the basic problem

  how to reroute flights  

  how to handle banks in the hub

- 4、compared to all others proposed in the literature(1994 a) for this problem

- 5、solve large scale, realistic size problems (several thousand flights).

#### problem definition

schedule flights in real time in order to minimize congestion costs

#### model formulation

- **<u>objective:</u>**  when each flight held on the ground and in the air in order to minimize the total delay cost.


- **<u>input data:</u>**

  flights

  airports

  time periods

  continued flights

  path

  capacity(air sector or depart airport and arrival airport)

  scheduled time(depart and arrival)

  cost(ground and in the air )

  must time in one sector


- **<u>decision variables</u>**:

  flight f arrives at sector j by time t.


- **<u>the objective function:</u>** （<u>**formula**</u>） (<u>minus</u>)

  - actual departure time - scheduled departure time    

    <u>**means**</u>

    <u>held on the ground time</u>     (1)


  - actual arrival time - scheduled arrival time -(actual departure time - scheduled departure time )

    **<u>equals</u>**

    (actual arrival time-actual departure time)-(scheduled arrival time-scheduled departure time)      

    **<u>means</u>**

    <u>held in the air time</u>      (2)

    ​

  so the minimize total delay cost <u>**equals**</u>

  (1) * cost on the ground +(2) *  cost in the air      (<u>mutiply</u> by)

#### solution algorithm

complexity of the tfmp is NP-hard problem

the author using a job-shop schedule to confirm all the constraints of the TFMP will be satisfied if and only if there is a feasible job-shop schedule.

#### modeling variations(could be used in many directions)

+ Dependence Between Arrival and Departure Capacities Hub Connectivity with Multiple Connections
+ Banks of Flights
+ Rerouting of Aircraft

####  implementation

 using cplex

#### case studies

Air Traffic Flow Management Problem Test Cases

performed one set of experiments in the <u>**four airports**</u> for 200 flights over a 24-hour time period and another set for 1,000 flights over a 24-hour time period.

- Boston Logan (BOS), 
- NY LaGuardia (LGA), 
- Washington National (DCA),
- a node representing all other airports(X)

For the set of <u>200 flights,</u> to solve the problem CPLEX requires <u>234 seconds CPU time.</u> 

For the <u>1000</u>, solve it at the infeasibility border over a <u>24 hour time</u> period.

## paper replication

#### algorithm design

I think it is a linear programming (LP).

main.cpp+tfmp.cpp+createInfo.cpp+commonFunction.cpp+ .h

Firstly, structure input

```c++
// create capacity Info.
        Create_capacity( D_k, A_k, S_sector, H, j);
 //create time Info. still have some problems
        Create_time( D_f, R_f, S_f, flight);
//create path
        Create_path( P, P_f, X, flight,j,env,H);
 //create the cost_g,cost_a,P_f
        Create_Cost( cost_g, cost_a, P.copy(), P_f.copy(), flight, t, env, X);
//create each flight's every sector's least-time
        Create_sector_time( L_sector, L_sector_f, X, flight,j,env,H,D_f.copy(),R_f.copy()); 
// create method
        create_sector_FeasibleTime(T_sector_first, T_sector_last, T_sector_first_f, T_sector_last_f, env, L_sector_f.copy(), D, D_f.copy(), R_f.copy(), X, flight);
```

Secondly,structure Objective function

Finally,structure Limit function (7 formula)

#### data structure

```c++
		//departure capacity
        IloNumArray D_k(env,H);
        //arrival capacity
        IloNumArray A_k(env,H);
        //sector capacity
        IloNumArray S_sector(env,j);
        
        //scheduled departure time
        IloNumArray D_f(env,flight);
        //scheduled arrival time
        IloNumArray R_f(env,flight);
        //turn around time after flight f;
        IloNumArray S_f(env,flight);
       
        // Path of a flight
        IloNumArray P(env,X+2);
        //flights' path
        IloNumArrayArray P_f(env,flight);
     
        // flight f cost on the ground
        IloNumArray cost_g(env,flight);
        // flight f cost in the air
        IloNumArray cost_a(env,flight);
       
        // Path's sector must spend time units
        IloNumArray L_sector(env,X+2);
        //flights' path-sector must spend time units
        IloNumArrayArray L_sector_f(env,flight);
        
        // first time period in the set T_f_j
        IloNumArray T_sector_first(env,X+2);
        // last time period in the set T_f_j
        IloNumArray T_sector_last(env,X+2);
        //flights' first time period in the set T_f_j
        IloNumArrayArray T_sector_first_f(env,flight);
        //flights' last time period in the set T_f_j
        IloNumArrayArray T_sector_last_f(env,flight);
```

#### implementation procedures

Using the Cplex and C++

the problems faced when I was coding 

- not familar with the Cplex and its c plus plus Reference Manual

- Promotional version problem.

  ​

#### convergence and computational efficiency analysis

NP hard (may not found solutions) taking the input info. into account.



#### scenario design

objective design

```c++
 // TFMP final target
        IloExpr FinalRes(env);

```c++
  //subject to 5
        for (int m=0; m<flight; m++) {
            for (int n=0; n<X+1; n++) {
                for (int p=0; p<t; p++) {
                    //if n~T_f_j(T_sector_first_f T_sector_last_f)
                    if(p<=T_sector_last_f[m][n]&&p>=T_sector_first_f[m][n]){
                        int lfj=L_sector_f[m][n];
                        if(p+lfj<t){
                            model.add(Wfst[m][n+1][p+lfj]<=Wfst[m][n][p]);
                        }
                    }

                }
            }
        }

#### case studies

For the set of <u>200 flights,</u> to solve the problem CPLEX requires <u>234 seconds CPU time.</u> 

For the <u>1000</u>, solve it at the infeasibility border over a <u>24 hour time</u> period.
