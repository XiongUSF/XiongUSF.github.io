## Change your settings for trusted computers

Your iOS device remembers the computers you've chosen to trust.
If you don't want to trust a computer or other device anymore, change the privacy settings on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch: In iOS 8 or later, tap Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy. Now when you connect to formerly trusted computers, the Trust alert will ask you whether you trust that computer. 

## development cannot be enabled while your device is locked

In the project navigator, click on your project, then go to Build Settings, then choose "All" to show all available settings. (It should be next to Basic and Customized buttons, these filter the settings shown). Then scroll down to "Signings", and there should be an option titled "Development Team".
